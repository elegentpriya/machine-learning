# Machine-learning
# 1. Hypothesis Testing 1: Working Mothers' Talk Time (Z-test)
Import the scipy.stats module, which provides statistical functions and distributions.

Define the given values:

sample_mean: The calculated mean from the sample data.
population_stddev: The standard deviation of the population.
sample_size: The size of the sample.
alpha: The significance level for the test.
Define the hypothesized population mean (hypothesized_mean), which is the value you want to test against.

Calculate the z-test statistic using the formula: (sample_mean - hypothesized_mean) / (population_stddev / (sample_size ** 0.5)). This statistic measures how many standard deviations the sample mean is away from the hypothesized mean.

Calculate the critical z-value using the inverse cumulative distribution function (ppf) of the standard normal distribution (stats.norm.ppf(1 - alpha)). This gives you the z-value beyond which you would reject the null hypothesis.

Compare the calculated z-test statistic with the critical z-value. If the calculated z-test statistic is greater than the critical z-value, you would reject the null hypothesis; otherwise, it fails to reject it.

# 2: Coffee Shop Wait Time (T-test)
Import the scipy.stats module, just like in the previous example.

Define the given values, including sample_mean, sample_stddev, sample_size, and alpha.

Define the hypothesized population mean (hypothesized_mean).

Calculate the t-test statistic using the formula: (sample_mean - hypothesized_mean) / (sample_stddev / (sample_size ** 0.5)). This statistic is similar to the z-test statistic but is adapted for smaller sample sizes using the t-distribution.

Calculate the degrees of freedom (degrees_of_freedom) for the t-distribution. It's one less than the sample size.

Calculate the critical t-value using the inverse cumulative distribution function (ppf) of the t-distribution (stats.t.ppf(1 - alpha, df=degrees_of_freedom)).

Compare the calculated t-test statistic with the critical t-value. If the calculated t-test statistic is less than the critical t-value, you would reject the null hypothesis; otherwise, you would fail to reject it.



# Data preprocessing
# Data Exploration:

List Unique Values: For each feature (column) in your dataset, you'll find the distinct values it contains. This helps you understand the range and variety of data in each feature.

Statistical Analysis: Calculate basic statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and other relevant measures for numerical features. This provides insights into the central tendency and spread of your data.

Rename Columns: If your columns have cryptic or unclear names, consider renaming them to make them more informative and consistent. Clear column names enhance readability and understanding.

# Data Cleaning:

Handling Missing Values: Identify columns with missing values. Based on domain knowledge, decide whether to remove the rows with missing values, replace missing values with mean/median/mode, or apply more advanced techniques like regression imputation.

Duplicate Rows: Identify and remove rows that are exact duplicates. Duplicate rows can lead to skewed analysis and modeling.

Outlier Detection and Treatment: Outliers are data points significantly different from others and can distort your analysis. Identify outliers using statistical methods (e.g., Z-score) or visualization techniques (e.g., box plots). Decide whether to remove, transform, or keep outliers based on your analysis.

# Data Analysis:

Filtering Data: Based on specified conditions, filter the data. In your case, filter rows where age is greater than 40 and salary is less than 5000.

Visualization: Create visualizations to gain insights. Plot a scatter chart to visualize the relationship between age and salary. Use appropriate libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to create clear and informative visualizations.

Count and Visualization by Category: Count the occurrences of each category and represent this information visually using charts like bar plots or pie charts.

# Data Encoding:

One-Hot Encoding: Convert nominal categorical variables (variables with no inherent order) into binary vectors. Each unique value becomes a separate binary column.

Label Encoding: Convert ordinal categorical variables (variables with a meaningful order) into numerical values. Each unique value is assigned a numerical label.

# Feature Scaling:

StandardScaler: This technique scales features to have zero mean and unit variance. It's important for algorithms that are sensitive to feature scales.

MinMaxScaler: This scales features to a specific range, often [0, 1]. It's useful when you want your features to lie within a certain range.
